# FM24: Wonderkid Recruiting Analysis

This project involves data-driven analysis of recruiting wonderkids in the **Football Manager (FM)** simulation game to identify top young talent.

## Project Overview

The goal of this analysis is to use data from **Football Manager 24** to evaluate and identify the most promising young players, referred to as **wonderkids**, who are expected to perform well in the game over time. The project includes:

- A deep dive into player attributes, growth potential, and career progression.
- An analysis of different regions and leagues to identify hotspots for recruiting wonderkids.
- A **Tableau dashboard** that visualizes the results of the analysis, allowing users to interact and explore data on various wonderkids.
